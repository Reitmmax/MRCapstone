		<p>These are animations I have made over the years. These were for an animation class in college. This showcases how I can use and manipulate shapes to make compelling animations for people. They are usuable on websites as well!</p>
	<h2>HTML CSS</h2>
	<iframe width="1920" height="720"  src="https://reitmmax.github.io/HTMLCSS/" allowfullscreen> </iframe>
		<br>
		<p>This was my first HTML page I made for college. This class taught me the basics: how to structer a page, how to make links, how to manipulate elements with CSS, how the hierarchy of a page works, and how to use iframes. This was they very beginning of my journey!</p>
	
	<h2>Adv HTML CSS</h2>
	<iframe width="1920" height="720" src="https://reitmmax.github.io/AdvHTML/" allowfullscreen> </iframe>
		<br>
		<p>This was a page I made later down the line! Another college page that taught me resposive design, how to make webpages accessible, how to use CSS and JavaScript to animate my pages, how to use a flexbox and grid, how to use SVGs and manipulate their content, how to disect a webpage, and how to use SASS. </p>
		
	<h2>JavaScript</h2>

		<br>
		<p>This was another one of my early pages. I learned how to use loops and arrays, how to write out and alert prompts, and how to do basic math with loops</p>
		
	<h2>Adobe XD</h2>

		<br>
	<p>This was a page for a midterm I made. I used Adobe XD to make it. It helped me use different transitions to other pages and on buttons. It also taught me how to prototype webpages before starting to make the actual thing.</p>
		
		<h2>WordPress</h2>
		<iframe width="1920" height="720" src="https://mreitmayercms.butlerccwebdev.net/"> </iframe>

		<p>I learned how to use the CMS WordPress during one of my classes.I learned how to make a theme and child theme, how to put JavaScript on a WordPress site, how to make plugins, how to install plugins, make a basic nav with the WordPress editor, how to add motion, how to make post, where I put my entire development process, and how to make the site more SEO optimal. </p>
